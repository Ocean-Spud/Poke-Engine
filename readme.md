# Poke (THIS PROJECT IS IN EARLY ALPHA)
## About the Project
The aim of the poke project is to create a graphics/game engine that portrays game dev in an easy, but transferable-to-later-on way. Using the tool, users will have the ability to add in objects and have poke do the heavy lifting, or design an engine themselves using their own shaders, code, etc.
